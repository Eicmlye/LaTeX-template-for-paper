### How to get the PDF file?

1. Copy and paste the file pgs/protected/[newChpt.tex](LaTeX_template/pgs/protected/newChpt.tex) to `pgs/` directory.
2. Rename the copy to, e.g. , `chpt2.tex`.
3. Insert the file to [paper.tex](LaTeX_template/paper.tex) in the document section.
   ```latex
   % -------- Enter here --------
       %% Copy&Paste pgs/protected/newChpt.tex to add new chapters.

   \include{pgs/chpt1.tex}
   \include{pgs/chpt2.tex} % This line is inserted.

   % -------- End --------
   ```
